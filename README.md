# Feature-Engineering-
# Feature Engineering is one of the keys to unlocking and power predictive insight. This, therefore, is a crucial step before instantiate model.

# In this repository I include two different tasks of feature engineering. One of them I have learnt from the BCG virtual internship for Data Science.

## BCG Virtual Internship
### Data: client_data, price_data
### Steps: 
1. Create new features
2. Transforming dates into months
3. Encoding categorical variables
4. Data transformation (log transformation)
5. Feature selection

## Pandemics and chronic kidney disease project
### Data: Kidney_disease
### Steps:
1. Cleaning data, filling missing data
2. Encoding data
3. Dimensionality reduction: PCA
